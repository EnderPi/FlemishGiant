- Create a skeleton windows form for genetic programming of RNG
- Create GCD test
- Create Gorilla Test
- Allow user to browse seed effects
- Split out clors of different bytes in randomness visual
- configure said colors and such
- configure tests
- have hash mode
- allow arbitrary output or state functions (expression)
- allow arbitrary restrictions, like "must include XOR"
- Add zero test
- unit test for randomHash - trivial pass GCD and gorilla test
- push the round function of the cryptographic has harder - see when, if at all, it fails as a 64-bit hash RNG
- Tab to just do randomness tests, allow user to code a state transition and an output
- Allow user to make custom tournament probabilities, even negative selection
- species explorer
- add nextlong to randomnumbergeenerator API (divide ulong by 2, reflect it?)
- Add special functions?
- remove prime testing?
