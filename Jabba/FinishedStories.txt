- Add zero test
- Create GCD test
- Create Gorilla Test
- build pseudo random function - takes a u64, seeds randomhash, then uses that to generate 64 32-bit keys, and creates a new U64->U64 function
- Create a skeleton windows form for genetic programming of RNG
	-So what's MVP?
	-Windows form
	-Click start
	-runs a simulation
	-displays picture + functions
	-all single state hard coded parameters
	-just the gcd test, capped at 100
	-single thread
	-10k max deviates
- remove prime testing?
- Allow user to view average fitness/generation
- disable form while running
- Add something like logging to the application?  Probably doesn't need saved to the file.
- write own RNG in assembly and test
- have hash mode
- Tab to just do randomness tests, allow user to code a state transition and an output
- overall stats for tests passed, failed (shows which tests are useful)
- Add refresh to log button
- add hash mode to testing
- add differential tests
- add linear tests
- add seed control to rng testing
- Make folding expressions recogniz (A-A = C(0))
- feistel rngs
